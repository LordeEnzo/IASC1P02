<h2> General </h2>
<div>
 <p> Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence,
which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony),
rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics
(loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).
Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements.
Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing
to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces
(such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.
The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses"). In its most general form,
the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on),
the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music.
Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and
vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and "it is music to
my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However,
20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example,
"There is no noise, only sound." </p>

 <p> The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according
to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have
been criticized as "not being music", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in
1825,[3] early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s. There
are many types of music, including popular music, traditional music, art music, music written
for religious ceremonies and work songs such as chanteys. Music ranges from strictly organized
compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to
spontaneously played improvisational music such as jazz, and avant-garde styles of
chance-based contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries.  </p>


 <p> Music can be divided into genres (e.g., country music) and genres can be further divided
into subgenres (e.g., country blues and pop country are two of the many country subgenres),
although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes
open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to
draw the line between some early 1980s hard rock and heavy metal. Within the arts, music may be
classified as a performing art, a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and
heard live at a rock concert or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a dramatic work
(a music theater show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player,
CD player, Smartphone or as film score or TV show.  </p>


 <p> In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a
key role in religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage),
social activities (e.g., dancing) and cultural activities ranging from amateur karaoke singing
to playing in an amateur funk band or singing in a community choir. People may make music as a
hobby, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra, or working as a professional musician
or singer. The music industry includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces
(such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra,
jazz band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music
(music producers and sound engineers), individuals who organize concert tours, and
individuals who sell recordings and sheet music and scores to customers. </p>

<h2> Etymology </h2>

 <p> The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").
   In Greek mythology, the nine muses were the goddesses who inspired literature,
  science, and the arts and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry,
  song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the Online Etymological
  Dictionary, the term "music" is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from Old French musique
  (12c.) and directly from Latin musica "the art of music," also including poetry
  (also [the] source of Spanish musica, Italian musica, Old High German mosica,
  German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik)." This is derived from the
  "...Greek mousike (techne) "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos
  "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)).
  Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In classical Greece,
  [the term "music" refers to] any art in which the Muses presided,
  but especially music and lyric poetry."  </p>

   <p> Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic
    pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product
    for the marketplace. When music was only available through sheet music scores,
    such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the sheet
    music of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home
    on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs,
    rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy
    their favourite songs. With the advent of home tape recorders in the 1980s and
    digital music in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or playlists of their
    favourite songs and take them with them on a portable cassette player or MP3 player.
    Some music lovers create mix tapes of their favorite songs, which serve as a
    "self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party...
    [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved."[7]</p>

     <p> Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure,
      and derive their income elsewhere. Professional musicians are employed by a range
      of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in marching bands, concert
      bands and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras,
      broadcasting or film production companies, and music schools. Professional musicians
      sometimes work as freelancers or session musicians, seeking contracts and engagements
      in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and
      professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take lessons with professional
      musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with
      professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community concert
      bands and community orchestras.</p>

       <p> A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience
        and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed
        through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also
        many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded
        and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music
        and in popular music forms such as rock, where illegally taped live concerts
        are prized by music lovers. In the jam band scene, live, improvised jam sessions
        are preferred to studio recordings.</p>

<h2> Notation </h2>

<p> In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes
  and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm
  of the music, such as the notes of a melody, are notated. Music notation also often
  provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for
  a song may state that the song is a "slow blues" or a "fast swing", which indicates
  the tempo and the genre. To read music notation, a person must have an understanding
  of music theory, harmony and the performance practice associated with a particular
  song or piece's genre.</p>

<p> Written notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is
   produced as sheet music or, for individuals with computer scorewriter programs, as an
   image on a computer screen. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or
   clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires
   an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the
   performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres
   requiring musical improvisation, the performer often plays from music where only the
   chord changes and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great
   understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre
   (e.g., jazz or country music).</p>

<p> In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores,
  which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the
  music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz,
  and blues, the standard musical notation is the lead sheet, which notates the melody,
  chords, lyrics (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. Fake books
  are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which
  permit rhythm section members to improvise an accompaniment part to jazz songs. Scores
  and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such
  as jazz "big bands." In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read
  music notated in tablature (often abbreviated as "tab"), which indicates the location of
  the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass
  fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the lute,
  a stringed, fretted instrument.</p>
