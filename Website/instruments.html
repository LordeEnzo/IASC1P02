<h2> History of Instruments </h2>
<p> A musical instrument is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds.
  In principle, any object that produces sound can be a musical instrumentâ€”it is through
  purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments
  dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used
  for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious
  ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for
  entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.</p>

<p> The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed.
  The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple flute,
  dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000
  years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical
  instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the
  relative instability of materials used to make them. Many early musical instruments were
  made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other non-durable materials.</p>

<p> Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world.
  However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most
  instruments in places far from their origin. By the Middle Ages, instruments from
  Mesopotamia were in maritime Southeast Asia, and Europeans played instruments from
  North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of
  North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. By 1400, musical instrument
  development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident.</p>

<p> Musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems
  of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their
  effective range, their material composition, their size, etc. However, the most common
  academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses the means by which they produce sound.
  The academic study of musical instruments is called organology.</p>

<h2> Classification </h2>
<p> There are many different methods of classifying musical instruments.
  Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument
  (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, the means by which music
  is produced with the instrument, the range of the instrument, and the instrument's
  place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic
  area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification
  requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification
  schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their
  original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a
  culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize
  Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more
  important, provides only possible classification for each instrument.
  The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind,
  and percussion. </p>
