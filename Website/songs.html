<h2> A-ha: Take on me </h2>
<p>"Take On Me" is a song by Norwegian synthpop band A-ha. Written by the band
members, the original version was produced by Tony Mansfield and remixed by
John Ratcliff. The second version of the song was produced by Alan Tarney for
the group's debut studio album Hunting High and Low (1985). The song combines
synthpop with a varied instrumentation that includes acoustic guitars, keyboards
and drums.

<p>The original "Take On Me" was recorded in 1984 and it took two versions
and three releases[clarification needed] to finally chart in the United Kingdom,
reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart in October 1985. In the United States
in October 1985, the song became the only A-ha song to reach the top position of
the Billboard Hot 100, due in no small part to the wide exposure on MTV of its
innovative music video, directed by Steve Barron. The video features the band
in a pencil-sketch animation method called rotoscoping, combined with live action.
The video won six awards and was nominated for two others at the 1986 MTV Video
Music Awards.</p>

<p>While never being a critical success, the song has engendered a huge cult following,
 and has become a stalwart on radio stations, in stadiums, and covered by almost
 every "80's band" in America[citation needed]. Many consider it one of the most
 revered songs in U.S. music history.</p>

<p>The band moved into an apartment in London and began calling on record companies
and publishing houses. After a few meetings with various AR personnel, the band
signed with a publishing house called Lionheart. A-ha then returned to Norway to
earn some money. When they returned to London, they left Lionheart out of frustration.
[4] They decided to record new demos, and chose the studio of musician and producer
John Ratcliff, intending to re-record five songs. The band signed with Ratcliff,
who in return introduced them to his manager, Terry Slater. With this encouragement,
the band managed to complete some songs, including "Take On Me". After a few
meetings, Slater signed them with Warner Bros. Records.</p>

<p>The band met with producer Tony Mansfield, an expert in the use of the Fairlight
CMI, who mixed the demos with electronic instrumentation. The sound was not what
A-ha had hoped to achieve, and the album was remixed again. The band rushed to
release "Take On Me" as a single in the United Kingdom but the single only charted
at 137, the lowest-charted of all A-ha songs. After this, Warner Brothers' main
office in the United States decided to invest in the band, and gave them the
opportunity to re-record the song.[4] Terry Slater convinced Alan Tarney to
produce the new version. The song was soon completed and re-released in the
United Kingdom, but the record label's office in London gave them little support,
and the single flopped for the second time.</p>

<h2> Johnny Cash: Ring of Fire </h2>

<p> "Ring of Fire", or "The Ring of Fire", is a song written by June Carter Cash
and Merle Kilgore and recorded by Johnny Cash.[1] The single appears on Cash's
1963 album, Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash. The song was originally
recorded by June's sister, Anita Carter, on her Mercury Records album Folk
Songs Old and New (1963) as "(Love's) Ring of Fire". "Ring of Fire" was ranked
No. 4 on CMT's 100 Greatest Songs of Country Music in 2003 and #87 on
Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[citation needed]<p>

<p>The song was recorded on March 25, 1963, and became the biggest hit of Cash's
career, staying at number one on the country chart for seven weeks. It was
certified Gold on January 21, 2010, by the RIAA and has also sold over 1.2
million digital downloads.</p>

<p>Although "Ring of Fire" sounds ominous, the term refers to falling in love â€“
which is what June Carter was experiencing with Johnny Cash at the time.
Some sources claim that Carter had seen the phrase "Love is like a burning
ring of fire," underlined in one of her uncle A. P. Carter's Elizabethan books
of poetry.[3][4] She worked with Kilgore on writing a song inspired by this
phrase as she had seen her uncle do in the past. She had written: "There is
no way to be in that kind of hell, no way to extinguish a flame that burns,
burns, burns"</p>

<p>Cash's first wife, Vivian Liberto, offers a different conception of
"Ring of Fire" in her book I Walked the Line. She contends that June
Carter Cash was not a co-writer of the song: "To this day, it confounds
me to hear the elaborate details June told of writing that song for Johnny.
She didn't write that song any more than I did. The truth is, Johnny wrote
that song, while pilled up and drunk, about a certain private female body part.
All those years of her claiming she wrote it herself, and she probably never knew
what the song was really about." Liberto claims that Cash decided to give Carter
co-writer status because "She needs the money".
The song was originally recorded by June's sister, Anita Carter,
on her Mercury Records album Folk Songs Old and New (1963) as "(Love's) Ring
 of Fire". Mercury released Anita's version as a single and it was a featured
"pick hit" in Billboard magazine.</p>

<p>After hearing Anita's version, Cash claimed he had a dream where he he
ard the song accompanied by "Mexican horns". Cash stated,
"I'll give you about five or six more months, and if you don't
hit with it, I'm gonna record it the way I feel it."
Cash noted that adding trumpets was a change to his basic sound.
When the song failed to become a major hit for Anita, Cash recorded it his own
way, adding the mariachi-style horns. This sound was later used in the song
"It Ain't Me Babe", which was recorded around the same time. Mother Maybelle
and the Carter sisters are prominently featured in the Cash recording singing
harmony. Cash tinkered with a few of the original phrases in Anita Carter's
version of the song<p>

  <h2 > Secret Song</h2>
<p id="omfg"> A song used on the OMFGDOGS website, not much is known about its origin.</p>

<h2> Hozier: Take me to church </h2>

<p>"Take Me to Church" is a song by Irish musician Hozier for his debut extended
play (EP) Take Me to Church (2013), as well as his self-titled debut album (2014).
The song was released as his debut single on 13 September 2013. Hozier,
a struggling musician at the time of its writing, wrote and recorded the
song in the attic of his parents' home in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland.
A mid-tempo soul song, its lyrics detail Hozier's frustration with the
Catholic Church and its stance on homosexuality. It first caught the
attention of independent label Rubyworks, where producer Rob Kirwan overdubbed
the original demo with live instruments. Only two musicians feature on the
track, Andrew Hozier-Byrne (Hozier) and drummer Fiachra Kinder.</p>

<p>The song's music video has contributed to its widespread popularity.
The clip, directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson of the small
production company Feel Good Lost, follows the relationship between
two men and the subsequent violent homophobic backlash. Upon its YouTube
release in September 2013, it quickly began to go viral, leading to Hozier's
license with Columbia Records.
In 2014, the song achieved widespread global popularity,
topping the charts in 12 countries, and also reached the top
10 in 21 other territories. In the United States, it was aided
by music platform Shazam and Spotify to become a rock radio hit
(where it spent 23 consecutive weeks at the top of the Hot Rock
Songs chart, tied with Imagine Dragons' "Radioactive" as the
longest-running number-one in its history at the time), later crossing
over to the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number two in
December 2014. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Song of the
Year at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. The song has been certified five
times platinum in the US.</p>
